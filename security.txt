Clarity is intended for development and is not currently intended to accept untrusted assemblies OR assemblies compiled from untrusted source code.

Known issues that would need to be resolved to make it work with untrusted code:
- Manglings are compacted to 64-bit hashes, which are easy to intentionally collide.
- Assembly validation is currently extremely minimal.
- Some constructs that are valid in .NET and export valid C++ will still fail to compile (i.e. lazy-instantiated generics).
- Macros from system headers can potentially cause tokens from emitted Clarity code to become other tokens, with unpredictable results.
