The RPA compiler converts CLI interfaces into static vtables.

RLO interface have 3 "strength" levels due to variance silliness and the "no match" slot bug.

Strength 0: Dynamic.  Slots of this type may be implemented by different interfaces depending on the type of the interface as invocation.  In these scenarios, it defers to an RloDynamicMethodSlot to handle resolution.
Strength 1: Weak terminator.  Slots of this type always implement a specific method if called directly, but may be implemented by another method if called from a dynamic search.
Strength 2: Strong terminator.  Slots of this type always implement a specific method if called directly and terminate dynamic searches.
